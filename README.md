# DeepLearningNotebooks
on neural network architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, LSTMs, Transformers, and learn how to make them better with strategies such as Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more. You will master these theoretical concepts and their industry applications using Python and TensorFlow. You will tackle real-world case studies such as autonomous driving, sign language reading, music generation, computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing.
